Currying is a term from functional-oriented programming. It is refered to the functions which return other functions. This program demonstrate a simple example, when inner "b" function does some calculation, but the outer "a" function returns not just the result of it, but the whole function "b".

Thus, when you call a function, you get another function, and you can call it too. That's why you have two pair of parentheses in "a(3)(4)".
