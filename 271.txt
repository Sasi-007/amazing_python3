The "dir" built-in function gives you a list that contains the names, which are defined in the current namespace. If you call it straight on, you get the list of items in the __main__ namespace. 

Compare the output of the same dir() call made inside the function. This function has a single variable "x", and that's the only name you see in the result of "dir".
