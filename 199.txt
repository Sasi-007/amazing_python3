Task: find a missing number in a list of integers. It is assumend that the list contains all numbers between 1 and N, and there is only one missing number there. The list is not sorted.

It is not wise to sort the data, as it will make the program slower with no gain. But it may be helpful to convert the data to a set (if the data size is big enough, it can make the search faster). #interviewquestions #programmininterview #pythoninterview #codinginterview #python #python3 #sorting #datasearch #programming #coders #codingquestions #toppython
