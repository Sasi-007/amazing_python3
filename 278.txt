Here's another method of merging two dictionaries (available from Python 3.5). Use the so-called "kwargs" syntax: **dict, which will "flat" its contents, and you will get a list of interchanging keys and values. The same happens to the second dictionary. The pair of curly braces create a new dictionary from that list.

Note that if you change the order of dictionaries, and they contain the same keys, you may get different results.
