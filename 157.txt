If you have to apply the same regular expressions many times, consider compiling it upfront to make the whole program faster.

In this exmaple, which continues the previous one with counting Unicode digits, the regex is first used 100,000 times in a loop, and then it is compiled once before entering the loop.

The program became two times faster after that simple step.
