Here is another way of reversing a list in Python. You can use the "reversed" built-in function. Note that in returns the "list_reverseiterator object", and if you need a list, you need to convert it by calling "list". 

You don't need to convert it to a list if you use the reversed function in a "for" loop, for example. It accepts iteratable objects, so it is fine to write "for x in reversed(data): ...".
