In this program, you have to guess the number between 0 and 10 that Python genrated using random.randint.

There are two infinite loops: the first one goes over games, the inner one gives different guessing attempts.

To stop the program, just hit Enter: in this case, the input cannot be converted to an integer, and Python raises an exception.
