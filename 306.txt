Here's another efficien way of clonign a list in Python. Just use the built-in "list" function which works as a constructor and creates a new list using the elemetns that you pass in an iterable argument.

In this example, when you assign the value of 99 to an element, you modify the new list "data2", while the old one, "data", stays untouched.
