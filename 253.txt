The "sort" method has a named parameter, "key", which you can use to sort complex data, where the sorting parameter is located a bit deeper then in, say, list of integers.

In the given example, we are sorting the list of dictionaries describing people, and we want to sort them by age. 

The "key" paramer gets a lambda function, that takes a dictionary (into "p") and returns the age from it.
