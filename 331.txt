Welcome to NumPy, a Python library for working with matrices. Or, in other words, with N-dimensional arrays. In the given example, we have an array of two arrays. The two arrays are called two axes. 

To create a data item, import the library ("import numpy"), and them create an array: "numpy.array(...)".

In this program, we check the shape, the number of dimensions, and the size of the array.

The type of the whole data structure is numpy.ndarray.
