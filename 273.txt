In Python, it is possible to redefine the default behaviour of the dir() function when it is applied to the instances of classes.

In this example, the class C has a function __dir__, which returns a custom list. Notice that if you pass the class name to the "dir" function, you will still see a lot of functions such as __init__ etc. Although, if you call it of the object "obj", the redefined method will be called.
