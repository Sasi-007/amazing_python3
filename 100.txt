Here is an exampe of a straightforward algorithm of generating a set of different random numbers. Even with a good generator of random numbers, if you are picking numbers from a limited set (just 100 numbers in this example), there's a chance to generate the same random number again. In this example, a set is used to keep already collected numbers and to check if the new one is already known.
