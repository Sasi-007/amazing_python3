There is a rectangular matrix (not necessarily square) of integers, and you need to transpose it. In other words, rows should become columns, and vice versa.

It is possible to use some library functions from numpy, for example, but let's solve it without any extra libraries.

The straightforward solution is to organise two nested loops and build the new matrix. It is also possible to use two nested list comprehensions, as shown in this solution.
