Here's a simple calculator that takes two operands (the numbers 3 and 4 in this example), and a character that represents an operation.

All actions, corresponding to the arithmetical operations, are collected in a dictionary. Each operation has two operands (x and y), and is coded as a lambda function.

The main calculator function ("calc") finds the operation and executes it by calling a function from the "ops" dictionary.
