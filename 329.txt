There are a few different ways to get a reversed list. In this example, three methods are demonstrated.

First, you can use a range with the third - step - parameter and set the step to -1. You will get a new list with reversed data in it.

Second, use the "reversed" built-in funciton. Please notice that in Python 3 the result of this function is a "list_reverseiterator object", and to get a list, apply the "list" function to it. (In Python 2, the object has the "listreverseiterator" class.)

THe above methods do not modify the original data. 

Finally, you can reverse the list in place by calling the "reverse" method on it. Be aware that it changes the list and does not return it.
