"List comprehensions" is a powerful technique in Python, although it may be a non-trivial for beginners.

In line 7 of this example, we are creating a new list using list comprehensions. For each number in the range (0 to 9), the "f(x)" function is called, and the result is appended to the "data" list.

After that, the generated values are printed in a human-readable format.
