Here's one of the simplest methods to check if a list contains only unique elements.

The list is converted to a temporary set, and as soon as there's a repeating element in the original data list, the set will not "accept" that element twice, and thus its length will not grow. 

In the end, you compare the lengths of the list and the set, and if they are different, then the list did contain duplicated items.
