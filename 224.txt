An implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm in Python.

In the algorithm, you take a list of data, choose a so-called pivot, and divide the data into two parts: the first part ("left") contains all items that are less than the pivot value, and the second part with all the other valeus.

Then you recursively sort each part again, and combine the result as list of those three parts: "left", pivot, and "right".

The choice of pivot is a separate theoretical question. The overall speed will depend on how well you choose it. In the given program, the pivot value is simply the first element of the data.
