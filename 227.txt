To generate the so-called Universally unique identifiers, or UUID (sometimes called GUID), just import the module "uuid" and call its "uuid4" function. You get a string containing a new UUID each time you call it.

#uuid #guid #randomnumber #randomgenerator #randomnumbergenerator #uuid4 #uuid1 #python #python3
