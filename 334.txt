Before you can start using the NumPy library in your Python programs, you need to install it. The easiest way is to to use the "pip" command-line tool, which does all the work for you. If you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed on your computer, you may want to prefer using "pip3" instead.

After you've intalled NumPy once, you can use it in all your future programs.
