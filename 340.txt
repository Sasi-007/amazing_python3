Here is another solution of the previous task: to tell if all the elements of a list are equal. This time, we are using the "all" built-in function, which returns True if all the data items passed to it are True.

Thus, we cannot directly use either data1 or data2 in the "all" function. First, you need to convert its elements to a Boolean value. You can choose to compare each element with the first element of the list. To achieve this, the simplest is to use a map and the lambda that converts each item to the Boolean value we need.
