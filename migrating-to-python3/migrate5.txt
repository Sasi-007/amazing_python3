Beware when rounding floating-point numbers that have exactly .5 as a fraction. In Python 2, you get the next integer number (so, 0.5 becomes 1, and 1.5 becomes 2).

In Python 3, the "Banker's rounding" principle is implemented, so the number is rounded to the nearest even number. This means that 0.5 becomes 0, and 1.5 is rounded to 2.
