In Python 3, using UTF-8 is much simpler than in Python 2. This example prints the Chinese version of "Hello, World!", and then prints the length of the string. 

The first differense is that in Python 2 you have to specify the encoding manually via a comment directive in the first line of the program. The second difference is that you do not get the correct length of the string in Python 2 when you use "len" directly. 

In Python 3, both operations (using a UTF-8 string and taking its length) are done intuitively.
