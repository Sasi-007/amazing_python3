It is possible to use C functions in your Python code. In this example, we create a simple function in C that adds two intergers: "int func(int a, int b)". The function is then compiled to a shared object (.so file), and is used from the Python script.

In Python code, the shared object is loaded using "ctypes.CDLL" function, and then is called as if it is a regular Python function, located in a module.
