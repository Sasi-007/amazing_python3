One of the important qualities of the random number generator is that it generates numbers equally distributed in the given range. You can quickly check it.

Generate many random numbers and distribute them to seaprate bins of a histogram. For example, if you generate numbers between 0 and 1000, make 10 cells and put all numbers below 100 to the first cell. 

In the result, you should see that in every histogram cell you have more or less equal number of elemenets. If that is so, your random number generator generates uniform distribution.
