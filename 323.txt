This example demonstrates how to execute a function in parallel using threads.

The main job is the function "do_work(x)" that takes a single argument and prints it after a small delay. Later, we create 10 jobs, each is a separate call of "do_work" but with different arguments (they increase from 0 to 9).

The jobs are submitted to an executor, which is an instance of ThreadPoolExecutor with 10 threads (maximum).

When you run the program a few times, you will see that the numbers are printed in different order.
