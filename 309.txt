This is the continuation of the previous example. The task is to take a list with nested lists and make it a flat structure. This time, we want to process nested lists too.

The most straightforward solution is to move the main algorithm to a function and call it recursively each time we see an iterable object. From the "flatten(data)" function we call "flatten(x)" passing the current element in the loop via the "x" variable.

You are still invited to invent an alternative algorithm.
