There are different ways to create a tuple in Python. The main idea is to use comma and list the items. You can use parentheses, but it is not strictly needed.

Pay attention when you create a tuple with a single element: you need a trailing comma (see #326).

It is also possible to use the name of the class as a function (as it is done for "t5"), and provide an iterable object for initialisation.
