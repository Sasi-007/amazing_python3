Sometimes you nedd to remove an element from a list, and to find the element, you need to scan the list. Do not remove the item *while* you are looping over the list. That may break the index in the best case, and you get out of index range.

The example diplayed here is an example of a bad style of programming. Do not follow it. 

If you need to remove an element, first get its index, for example, and then remove it outside of the "for" loop.
