Here's a simple solution of a simple task: to calculate the area of a triangle if you are given the length of its three sides.

The lengths of the sides are entered manualy, and the furmula to compute the area is hardcoded in the code.

No loops or lampda are used in the solution, although it may be a good excercise to use them.
