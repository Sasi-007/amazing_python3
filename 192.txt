The taks is to find the indices of the elements in the list, which are equal to the given value.

In the example, there's a list with a few strings, and we need to find the positions of all 'beta's.

A list comprehension in combination with the built-in "enumerate" function can solve the task. "enumerate" returns a list of tuples (index, element), and we filter that list by comparing the element with the desired value.
