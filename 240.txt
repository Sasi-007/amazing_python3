It is also possible to use fractions in your Python programs. Not just floating-point numbers, but real fractions with numerator and denominator.

Use the "fractions" module from the standand library and create the objects of the "Fraction" type.

As shown in the example, Python keep both numerator and denominator instead of converting a number to a floating-point number.
