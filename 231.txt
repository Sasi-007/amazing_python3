Regular expressions can help to clean the text and remove double spaces from it. In this program, a simple regular expression \s{2,} is used to find sequences of one or more spaces. You can use \s+, but it will replace single spaces too, which is fine and gives the same result, but is definitely redundant.

The "r" prefix before the regex string informs Python about the raw-string, thus backslashes will not have special meaning in the string (but they will do in the regex itself).
