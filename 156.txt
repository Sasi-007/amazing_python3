In this program, we are looping over a range of Unicode characters with the codepoints between 32 (space) and 10,000. Each character is then tested against a regular expression \d, which only matches digits.

But digits in the Unicode are far beyond the ten familiar digits between 0 and 9. You can find more than 500 other characters (with the codes above 10,000, too), which are also digits.

To limit the regex to work only in the ASCII subspace, add the re.ASCII flag.
