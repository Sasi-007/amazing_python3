Iterators can be directly used in a "for" loop. In this example, we are creating a class that can be used for counting objects. The object keeps its ranges, and returns an incrementing value each time the "next" call is implicitly applied to it.

The example demonstrates a trivial case of incrementing integers, but you may think of a more complex behaviour.
