Here is the task: tell if the two text strings are anagrams (i.e. contain the same letters but maybe in different order).

One of the possible solution is to use the Counter functions from the collections standard library.

The function returns a dictionary with the result of counting each character in a string. If such a dictionary is the same for another string, then the strings are anagrams.
