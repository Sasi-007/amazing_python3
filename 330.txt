This program demonstrates how you can "invert" a dictionar and exchange its values with its keys (assuming that the values do not repeat in the original dictionary).

Here, the so-called dictionary comprehension is used. Inside curly braces, you explain how you want to build a new dictionary using the keys and values from original data.
