When you are working with "for" loops in Python, you have to understand when and how Python calls the function that you have in the header of the loop. 

In the given example, the loop determines the size of the data list and creates the range (from 0 to 4) to iterate over it. The question is how many times do you expect both "range" and "len" functions to be called? Are they called on each iteration or only once?

If you know the answer, then here's an additional one: how to confirm your answer?
