This is a continuation of the previous example. Now, we want to make sure that the function in the header of the "for" loop is only called once (which is the correct answer).

To see it explicitly, move the condition logic to a separate function, and print something from it.

In the output, you will see that the function only prints the message once, which means that it was called only once.
