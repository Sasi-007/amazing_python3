Creating a simple web server using the standard library. There is "http.server" module in Python 3, which has some functionality to build the server that lists the directory and browses files, etc. 

This module is not recommended for production due to low security, but is a good thing to learn in class.

The program stars a loop that runs a server on the port 5000 and listens to all IP addresses (localhost at least).
