To calculate the difference between dates, the easiest way is to just subtract the second date from the first one :-)

Use the datetime.date function from standard library to create a date. The type of the "date_to - date_from" is <class 'datetime.timedelta'>. It gives the detailed difference up to seconds. To get only days, call the "days" method.
