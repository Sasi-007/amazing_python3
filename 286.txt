A class in Python can have the __repr__ method, which will be responsible for how the object is printed when you pass it to the built-in "print" function.

The method should return a string, and in this example this string contains some text and the value of one of the attributes of the class.

If you create two objects with different value of self.v, they will be printed differently.
