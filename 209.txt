In Python 3.8, you can use hte := operator to assign a value to a variable *inside* the expression. Be careful not to to surround the assignment with parentheses in some cases.

In the example, the "str" variable gets a next string from the input file, and it is immediately compared with the stop word. Traditionally, you would use "break" to stop the loop.

The operators is also caleld "walrus" because of its two tusks.
