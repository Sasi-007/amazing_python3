There is no built-in function in Python to check if the given number is a prime number, but it is easy to implement it yourself. The number n is not prime if there is such other number m (one or more) below n that you can divide n by m with no remainder. If you cannot find such m then the number is prime. The "not(n % m)" check returns True if n is divisible by m.
