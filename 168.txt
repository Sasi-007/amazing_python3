In Python, there is a "filter" built-in function, but you can also use a list comprehension with a condition to do the job.

In this example, we have a list of ten numbers, and we re-build the list by taking the numbers that satisfy the condition of "x < 4". #filtering #grepping #dataprocessing #bigdata #datahandling #python #pythonfunctions #datastructure #python3 #programming #effectiveprogramming #functionalprogramming
