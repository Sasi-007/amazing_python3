In Python, you can find the "array" module that comes as a part of the distribution. This module provides us with an implementation of arrays, which are similar to lists, but there is a very important difference that all elements of an array must be of the same type.

The type of the element is defined via a one-character string at the time of creation, for example: array.array('i') for integer arrays.

You can index the elements as you do with lists: a[1] or you can assign a new value to it: a[1] = 99, but you have to make sure that the assigned value is of the correct data type.
