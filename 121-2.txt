Python uses common conventions as to escaping characters in strings. Such as \n which becomes a newline.

But with the "r" prefix, you can create a so-called "raw string" that will not escape backslash-prefixed characters. With a raw string, you will see "\n" in the output as is: backslash and "n". #strings #escaping #stringescaping #rawstring
