This example demonstrates the main feature of polymorphic methods in OOP. We have a few classes, and a list of instances of those classes. Each class has the method named "talk", and that method is called for each object in the list.

The great part is that even if the method name is the same, objects know how to call the method from the correct class. Thus, when x is a dog, the Dog.talk() method is called. When it is a cat, Cat.talk() is triggered. You do not need to store any extra information to distinguish between the object types.
