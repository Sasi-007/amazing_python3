A simple way to check if all the elements in a given list are equal.

The method is the following: you convert a list to a set. With this opearation, the same elements will form only a single element in a set. Thus, all duplicated elements will go. If in the end you have a set of only one element, that means that you had only equal elements in the original list.

Notice that if you have a list of a single element, the answer will always be True.
