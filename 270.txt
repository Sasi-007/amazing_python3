Python's version is a series of three numbers, for example, 3.6.4. The first is the major version number (here, Python 3), the second is a minor version number, and the third is the so-called micro-level. It increments with bugfixes, for example. Additional letters after the microversion can say if it is an alpha ("a") or beta ("b") release. In the example, 3.8.0b1 is beta 1.

To see the version string, call Python with the -V command-line option.
