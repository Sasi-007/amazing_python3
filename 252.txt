You have two lists of integers. You need to get the third list, where every element is the sum of corresponding elements from the two lists.

This task can be solved with a loop, or with a map as shown here. As "map" needs a function, we can use the wrapper from the "operator" module that is available in the standard library.

The same code works if the elements of the lists are strings, for example, In that case, the resulting list will contain concatenated strings.
